## <div align="center">About Us 👥</div>

The GKSS UNISA chapter is dedicated to fostering a vibrant community of student developers at the University of South Africa. Our mission is to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical software development while creating meaningful connections within the tech community.

## <div align="center">Our Goals for 2024 🎯</div>

- Build a strong community of UNISA student developers
- Create and contribute to open source projects
- Enhance our programming skills in C++ and Python
- Develop practical solutions for UNISA students
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing

## <div align="center">GKSS-UNISA on GitHub 💻</div>

We are excited and cannot wait to make an impact! That however, only makes sense if we have an active developer community that **actually** develops. That's where you come in.
We'd love to have an open source community for our chapter, where fellow UNISA students will be the main contributors and inventors of all kinds of crazy software that we will
use to up the efficiency of our studies & everyday lives as open distance e-learning students.

## <div align="center">Focus Areas 🎯</div>

As UNISA students, we're particularly interested in strengthening our skills in the core programming languages taught in our curriculum. While these are our main focus areas, we're not limited to them and welcome projects in any programming language:
