# GKSS | UNISA

We are a chapter of the Geekulcha Student Society ([GKSS](https://geekulcha.dev/gkss)) program which is the part of the [Geekulcha](https://geekulcha.dev)
organisation that brings closer the developer community & leadership skills to students in universities.

## GKSS-UNISA on GitHub

We are excited and cannot wait to make a impact! That however, only makes sense if we have an active developer community that **actually** develops. That's where you come in.
We'd love to have an open source community for our chapter, where fellow UNISA students will be the main contributors and inventors of all kinds of crazy software that we will
will use to up the efficiency of our studies & everyday lives as open distance e-learning students.

## Contributing

We are actively working of developing our ecosystem. With that, we are also working on bettering our developer experience. Soon enough we will have a clear guidline to help
contributors get on board.
